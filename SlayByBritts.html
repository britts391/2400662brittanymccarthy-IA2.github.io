            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>
                We are a small but passionate party decorating company made up of a close-knit team of ten. Slay by Britts was founded in 2022 by our owner, Brittany McCarthy,
                whose love for decorating has always been driven by the joy it brings to others. Brittany began by creating beautiful setups for her family’s birthdays, baby showers,
                and other celebrations. Her creativity and attention to detail were always met with tremendous praise, but she never considered turning it into a business until the
                pandemic.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During that time, Brittany reflected on her passion and realized that bringing people’s visions to life was what she truly wanted to do.
                With determination and courage, she saved her life savings, took out a business loan, and rented a small shop in the New Kingston Business Center.
                With the support of her family and friends, she worked tirelessly to turn her dream into reality.

                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Slay by Britts continues to bring smiles and sparkle to every event ,one decoration at a time.
                We’ve become known for our affordability, creativity, and wide range of customizable packages to suit any occasion.
                At Slay by Britts, we believe everyone deserves a little joy in their life , and what better way to celebrate than with a beautifully decorated, glamour-filled party?
